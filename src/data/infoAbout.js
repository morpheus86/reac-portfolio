  about:
    "My story is similar but at the same time quite different to a lot of the immigrant that lives in New York. Searching for a better future while striving to challenge myself and helping contribute to a better community both socially and physically. I became a software Engineer in order to contribute in the advancement of my community and at the same time be around mind like people. I graduated from Full Stack Academy of Code, one of the most prestigious coding schools in the greater New York area. I feel very comfortable and happy designing and analyzing algorithms as well as learning new technologies and working with the tools of different technologies I have acquired. I specialize in building full stack web applications through NERD stack (Node, Express, React, React-Redux and database). Aside from developing scalable web and mobile apps, I am also a personal trainer, I am very passionate about what i do which make me give my best and be the best in anything i put my mind to. I am an avid learner of new technologies, a fine food lover. On my free time I like to compete playing soccer, basketball and socializing with friends and family trying not to think about code."
